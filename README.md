# Lykkehjulet android application

The wheel of fortune (known as Lykkehjulet in Denmark) is an individual assignment provided by my professor at DTU in the course 62550 User experience and mobile applications. 

The application is designed for android devices and will be executed in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

# What is Lykkehjulet?

Lykkehjulet is inspired off the American TV show "Wheel of Fortune". The gameshow offers participants a chance to win a big array of prices by guessing the word selected by the gameshow.
